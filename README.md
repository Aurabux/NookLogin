# NookLogin
This Website was made in summer 2019 for a class where we had to make a login page

I had to accomplish the following for a class
Sign Up – User will provide some basic information like name, username, email, password, etc. to create an account.
Sign In – User will utilize the username and password to log in to the application.
Reset Password Questions – Ask the user to enter answers to some basic questions that can be utilized to reset the password later.
Forget Password (or Username) – Use the questions to make sure that the user is authentic and allow the user to reset password
Reset password using email – send a token or temporary password to email and utilize it to reset password
For Assignment 1, we will implement (1) Sign Up and (2) Sign In. We will use the user’s email address as the username.

To-Do:
-Create a home screen that consists of two text boxes. One for email and another for the password. 
-Create a log in button that will allow the user to login. 
-Upon successful login take them to a dummy welcome screen that states Welcome first name, last name. 
(First and last name of logged in user).
-Below the login button, add a new user sign up link that will take the user to sign up screen.
-User can add first name, last name, birth date, email, and password to sign up.
-When User Sign up, take them to Welcome Screen.
